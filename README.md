# PYISAC-CORE - PYthon InfraStructure As Code Core Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/r3alityc0d3r/pyisac-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/r3alityc0d3r/pyisac-core)

## About

This project will hopefully be a new way to think about configuration management
and application deploment.  It is my hope to design a way to define your infra-
structure in regular python code and use that code to not only perform 
configuration management but also a simple way of deploying applications.

This project is the core server that runs configurations and application
deployement

## Installation
Coming soon!
